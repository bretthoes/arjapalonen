    <h1 class="page-header">Arja Palonen and the Studio 737 Art Galleries</h1>
    <p class="body-text-left fade-in">
      Arja has been painting for over 60 years and she is not only noted for her artwork, but as an entrepreneur having
      owned the three <strong><em>“Studio 737 Art Galleries”</em></strong> for these past 30 years.<br />
      Arja began painting in earnest in 1985, while residing in Newfoundland where her husband, Joe Kurek was stationed
      at the Naval Base near Placentia for four years. Several hundred of her oil paintings done on locations depicting
      the nearby landscapes were sold out of her home and all signed again with her first name, “Arja”. Their home
      turned into a gallery, as more and more people came looking to buy her work. You may have purchased more than a
      painting of hers and one day soon, she should become recognized and respected not only for her art, but for her
      positive influential actions within Canada’s artistic profession!<br /><br />
      Upon her husband Joe’s retirement from the U. S. Navy in 1989, Arja, as a Canadian, wanted to remain in Canada and
      to continue her Art Career. They were driving back to Ontario, where Arja’s family resided and looking for
      possible places along the way, on the Trans Canada Highway #7, between Ottawa and Toronto, at the junction of
      Highway #37, they found and old abandoned truck stop restaurant suitable for the location. The retail building
      from 1950's, with a newer home combination and a large parking lot and 15 acres of land, they contacted the
      realtor and were shown the property and decided it would work for Arja’s studio and perhaps, maybe a display of
      her work, as well as, 15 other artists works. Decision was made and she ended purchasing the property.<br /><br />
      They decided to call it, <strong><em>“Studio 737 Art Galleries”</em></strong> , because of the location on Hwy #7
      and proximity to Hwy #37.
      After several years, we were displaying not only 15 but 70 talented Canadian Artists, and by then with over
      <strong><em>1,200 ORIGINAL </em></strong>
      Canadian works of Art for sale. We decided right from the start not to deceive our customers with any
      reproduced copies from the far East, no matter how many numbers, or signatures appeared on these pieces of paper!
      We had our Art Gallery filled with only Original Art and and our customers appreciated it!<br /><br />
      It took a lot of effort and money just to to renovate and convert an empty building 'in the middle of nowhere' so
      to speak, by adding display walls, advertising signage on the building itself and on the highway, and in our case,
      we were lucky, as the whim paid off. To be a factor and competitive in the art business, a gallery has to sell
      artwork, and in 30 years over 3,500 pieces of art were sold! To have accomplished this by adding these paintings
      for future generations to admire makes us very happy and proud. These sales were done not to gouge our customers,
      but rather helping them decorate their homes with something original that would give them pleasure for years to
      come! For three decades it worked, as we ran a very honest and sincere business, and both our artists and
      customers appreciated it.<br /><br />
      We have had a number of important customers who have frequented our three, Studio 737 Art Galleries. The Original
      location on Highway #7, a satellite location in Richmond Hill, Ontario and after closing our original Gallery on
      Highway #7, we opened our <strong><em>FINAL</em></strong> Art Gallery in Barrie, Ontario where we now reside. Our
      artists exhibiting their
      works in our three galleries was just awesome! For those of you, who are into the Canadian old Art market, if you
      want to be impressed, we even sold one of the earliest Jean Paul Riopelle’s, a 16 x20 for $45,000, back in 1990,
      which today would go for a quarter of a million, that someone consigned to us to sell! Also a number of Group of
      Seven sketches were also consigned, not like completed oil paintings, like our artists made on location, as you
      just can't capture the whole feeling of the subject matter in a sketch, but you have to paint that moment, right
      there at that scene!<br /><br />
      We will now name two artists besides Arja, that really need mentioning, the first one was a young lady named, Beth
      Hoselton. She was only 18 years old, and her work was introduced to us by her artist father, Carl back in 1990.
      Her portfolio of detailed acrylic works just blew us away, and so we, of course, hung her work up immediately and
      after 30 years and 500-600 of her sales, we would have to consider her as one of Canada’s top wildlife artists.
      Almost all of her wildlife works show the mothering instinct in the animal kingdom better than most! Just wait
      until her work starts hitting those auction houses one day, if they haven't already!<br /><br />
      The artist, Donald Gordon Fraser has had his accomplishments ignored,so we're using this article to amplify his
      success as a painter and the staggering amount of his paintings that we sold! Canadian Art Collectors really don’t
      have a true Canadian art collection without a Fraser's work! Don Fraser was actually Arja’s life drawing
      instructor in Toronto, when she had emigrated to Canada with her family in 1957 from Finland and entered the
      Central Technical Art School, where he taught life drawing. Years later imagine her surprise, when she went out
      painting with a group of artists on location North of Peterborough, Ont., and that Mr. Fraser was one of those
      artists. She then approached him and asked, if he would like to exhibit his work in our Gallery and he accepted.
      Arja went to visit his home bringing back about 15 of his oil paintings. They were all very powerful impressionist
      pieces! In no time we sold those 15 paintings and we both went over to Mr. Fraser's home to select another batch.
      He greeted us and took us up to his attic, and we knew we hit the jackpot. There were over 800 oil paintings on
      masonite panels from sizes 16”x 20” to 36”x 48”. These were not sketches, but completed paintings, we thought the
      attic might even collapse from the weight. Downstairs in his studio were over 2,000 finished watercolours and his
      famous sepia and charcoal character sketches, which he had accomplished while living and teaching art in Toronto.
      The majority of these on paper were not signed, and as we would select the paintings we wanted, then Mr. Fraser
      would sign them. We sold over 1,100 of Mr. Donald Gordon Fraser’s works during these 30 years, and even selling
      his re-sales after his passing in 2003.<br /><br />
      In 1993, Dr. Thierry Lefrancois, a Museum Director from France, happened to stop by the restaurant just down the
      road from our Gallery for lunch and had seen the three paintings that Don allowed us to hang there. They were very
      large masterpieces, and we hung them there to show the general public a taste of real art hanging in our Gallery,
      just down the road. <em>Dr. Lefrancois picked up one of our brochures and started communicating with us at
        <strong>Studio 737</strong></em>,
      Arja and myself were awestruck at what this gentleman presented. He asked, if we could contact Mr. Fraser to see
      if Don would be willing to do a four-month Art Exhibition in his Museum in France!<br /><br />
      At the time, we did not know, there had never been a “Living Canadian Artist” to have had a Museum Exhibition
      outside of Canada. We visited Mr. Fraser and explained the letter. At first, to our surprise Don Fraser declined
      from this exhibition, even we told him, that it was like winning the award from the Academy of Art and we were
      sure surprised of his reaction. However, when Arja, picked up Don Fraser for a painting trip a few days later,
      <strong><em>ARJA then EXPLAINED TO DON THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS MUSEUM EXHIBITION IN 1995 WOULD BE NOT ONLY
          FANTASTIC FOR
          HIS ART CAREER, BUT FOR CANADA AND EVERY OTHER CANADIAN ARTIST PAINTING OUTDOORS, as well!</em></strong> Don,
      finally agreed
      with Arja, and told her to go ahead and reply to Dr. Lefrancois and at the same time, Mr. Fraser, with the help of
      his daughter-in law, wrote back to Dr. Lefrancois a letter of acceptance. Studio 737 became more involved with the
      details of the exhibition, while Mr. Fraser became involved with the selection of his Artwork. The FRENCH
      GOVERNMENT paid for this entire exhibition the crating, shipping the advertising and Mr. Fraser and his Family’s
      flights and hotel reservations. Not a penny was paid by the Canadian Government. “ARJA, a Canadian Immigrant from
      Finland and myself an American flew to France to open Mr. Donald Gordon Fraser's Art Exhibition in June of 1995 on
      behalf of the Canadian People!<br /><br />
      One has to ask why? Well, in March of 1995, Prime Minister Jean Chretien was on CJOH-TV explaining, that Canada
      should have more Canadians' Works of Art exhibited outside of Canada! Therefore, on April 7, 1995, we presented to
      him an invitation to Mr. Donald Gordon Fraser’s Museum Art Exhibition in France. Ambassador Bouchard in France was
      also contacted and offered an invitation, but both of these individuals said they were too busy? One would have to
      think, why would they be too busy to assign another Canadian from their own party for this opening? I wrote to the
      Director of the National Gallery of Canada and the Museum Director of the Art Gallery of Ontario even the
      McMichael Collection Administrator they did nothing, just replied that they would put the information in their
      files on Mr. Fraser. Over the years that followed I wrote to several Prime Ministers from both Parties, a Governor
      General, and over a hundred Parliamentarians and Senators. So, you see, I did more to promote Mr. Fraser than
      anyone else. How many art dealers would go to this extent?<br /><br />
      Later on, we found out that Mr. Chretien donated a painting (we hope it wasn’t a Group of 7 member) to the
      National Gallery and received a 25K income tax deduction along with a Canadian actress, who received a 50K
      deduction for her donation. The Director of the National Gallery of Canada, Mr. Charles Hill published a book on
      the Group of Seven in 1995, just imagine his book sales, if this Fraser Exhibition was broadcast all over the
      media in 1995? All these other museums, galleries, auctioneers seemed to ignore Mr. Fraser, why?
      Before Don died, he gave us an important file and what we gleaned from it was, that he was let go from the Ontario
      College of Art in the early 1950’s, because he wrote a Critique on the Group of Seven that was published in the
      school newspaper. We have a copy, and it is a very congealed description of all seven members. Some of these
      members of the group were art instructors along with Don! He wrote this critique, as an instructor to assist
      artists to understand their painting styles, and not as an attack against any member of the Group. We believe,
      somebody with a lot of money and interest with this College of Art, had Mr. Fraser's work ignored. I have a B &W
      photo of Don walking into the Thompson Gallery in Toronto with a painting, the same Gallery that represented the
      Group! So why was this talented artist' works ignored ?<br /><br />
      In the Toronto “Evening Telegram article, on Saturday, Feb 18, 1928”: The Art Gallery of Ontario, “Exhibition of
      Canadian Paintings By the Group of Seven” the article states: “Junk Clutters Art Gallery Walls While Real
      Paintings Are Hidden in Cellar”! In 1928, these seven Artists were really not that popular according to this
      article! Critics will be critics, as I mentioned earlier, I even had a person once tell me, that Arja was copying
      Mr. Fraser’s work? That person must realize by now, that nobody can copy anyone's work, but can always learn from
      it, after all she was one of his students, and later on one of his painting partners!<br /><br />
      The Group of Seven members travelled by train to Buffalo, New York to visit an exhibition of European
      Impressionists, at the Albright Knox Art Gallery and were turned on by their work, and after they came back to
      Canada and these seven, who back then in the 1920's earned their living doing etchings for the Toronto newspapers
      and magazines of photography, were very much influenced by their works. They painted art in their off time then
      and it was difficult for them to do it without private vehicles to travel to different locations, as artists did
      in the 1960’s and there on could. A few individuals with money had to get behind these artists and start
      purchasing their works? Who? How did Mr. Donald Gordon Fraser’s article at OCA and artwork almost get in their
      way? Was he really that much of a threat?<br /><br />
      With thousands of artists in Canada, why is the focus only on these Seven? Maybe because The Group of Seven
      artworks became a legitimate Ponzi scheme using the Canadian Art deduction law, which allows the Canadian art
      investors, Companies, and Corporations, deduct the cost of the art purchases over a six-year period, no matter how
      much they cost? Two years ago, a large, Lawren Harris painting of the mountains out West, was purchased by an art
      buyer from California for 11 million dollars. Because the painting was shipped outside of Canada the Canadian
      Government lost $1,300,000 in HST taxes.<br /><br />
      Mr. Fraser was also employed in both CBC and CTV television stations to earn a living. He painted set stages and
      portraitures for television, just as even today, the most artists need to make a living by doing additional work.
      Don Fraser’s portraits were like those of the old Masters paintings hanging in the European Museums! However, none
      of the members of the Group of Seven never really painted portraitures.<br /><br />
      Dr. Lefrancois, the museum director in France, held a Doctorate in Fine Arts from the Louvre in Paris, which meant
      that he understood and studied the Great Masters of the World! There is no Museum Director in Canada, or the
      United States with this Doctorate in Fine Arts from the Louvre? After Dr.Lefrancois examined a number of
      photographs of Don’s work, in his letter to Mr. Fraser in 1993, he stated: “I believe that I was not mistaken in
      judging you to be the living heir of the Group of Seven”. Our reply to Dr. Lefrancois in 1994 was, that it should
      be changed to “one of the living heirs” as per Mr. Fraser’s request. So, just like his critique on the Group of
      Seven, Mr. Fraser was a very modest artist not seeking much fame, or taking away from others, I don’t really think
      he cared of money, just painting! His family took him to see the art at the Louvre in Paris and to attend his own
      show opening. Here was an artist, who picked up a book about Homer Watson as a young lad and started painting
      without any instructor, or teacher, eventually becoming an art instructor himself and now standing amongst all
      this fantastic art in front of him and he is here because of the work he himself created. We can only imagine how
      he felt!<br /><br />
      How many other youngsters here in Canada and the United States are out there that possess a God given talent? We
      perhaps fail for them to succeed by duplicating what happened to Donald Gordon Fraser? Arja was lucky, as she had
      some art training and began to draw and paint in Finland before immigrating to Canada with high marks from first
      grade on, and throughout her high school art course there and in Toronto, and getting Mr. Fraser as an instructor
      for her life drawing class at Central Tech. High School.<br /><br />
      After Mr. Fraser’s exhibition in France, I sat down with him and told him that, because of all his art sales, the
      Canadian Government was going to nail him on income taxes of the sale of his works and suggested that he hold
      another show here in Canada, as well. He then signed Arja on, as his exclusive art agent and we decided to find a
      hotel in Toronto to hold a one man show and sale. The Ballroom of the Toronto Harbour Castle Hotel was chosen for
      an entire week with security, lights, panels and advertising, for which Mr. Fraser agreed. The show ended up
      costing Don $45,000 in 1997. This had never been done by any Canadian Artist! We sold three quarters of the 72
      paintings that were available, and the show was needless to say: “A Great Success”!<br /><br />
      Over the years we sold over 1,100 of his paintings and <strong><em>never forcibly insisted for anyone to purchase
          these</em></strong>, so
      why then did everybody purchase them? You cannot really answer this question by hiding his work away from the
      public, knowing full well, it will for a fact turn the Canadian Art World on its head! People with money and
      influence are not that ignorant not to want to follow up on his art, just like was done earlier by individuals of
      that Ponzi Scheme. There is Scheme with Donald Gordon Fraser’s work, his paintings were sold to hundreds and
      hundreds of buyers over the years. We have the records and know the titles, sizes, medium and prices of each piece
      sold. We believe that 49 of his paintings have now hit the auction market, because many of our old clients, who
      bought them and have passed them on to their heirs. Studio 737 has sold Mr. Fraser’s best works over the years,
      and we, were sure of that! We returned the items not sold, back to the Fraser Estate in 2011, at their request.
      The heirs of those original buyers may not find them suitable for their homes, but those original purchasers knew
      what they were all about, as you just cannot find another piece of art to replace a Fraser on your wall, it’s like
      removing that wall, as they are so powerful and intense. We believe that his portraitures and landscapes in oil
      are the most powerful of any Canadian Artist, perhaps due to his ambidexstrous ability. We no longer own or are
      seeking to own Mr. Fraser's work so we have no benefit to gain in this article. It, is soley for the benefit of
      all of our customers who purchased his works over these past years.<br /><br />
      I thought that Barrie, Ontario would be a good location to open our final Gallery, with the close proximity to
      Toronto and that it would make it a great location and talked Arja into my idea. We ended up renting a store
      available there and in three months time, I built additional walls in a large unit and added extra lighting to
      enhance art. Many customers told us that the Studio 737 Gallery was superior to the Barrie Art Gallery. The mayor
      himself was unable to attend our opening, but sent a representative. Mr. John Brassard, the Conservative Member of
      Parliament, came to our opening and introduced himself and was greatly impressed by our artists' works, and why
      would he not have been, as many of our regular talented artists had once again joined Arja in this endeavor almost
      overnight? After all we had operated two other Studio 737 Art Galleries up til' then.<br /><br />
      Unfortunately, after operating it for almost a year, it turned out that this location was a fatal mistake, as rent
      was high, and not enought purchasing customers. Perhaps, because Barrie is now just like a suburb of Toronto, a
      50-minute drive away and most of these residents leave Barrie at 6am and drive to Toronto to go to work. If you
      walk into most galleries in the big city, many just walk right out, as the pricing is out of sight, which was not
      the case in our gallery, but it didn't help! So sadly we closed the place down after artists had picked up their
      works.<br /><br />
      I sat down and drafted and emailed a letter to to Prime Minister Trudeau, as well as, five of his Cabinet
      Ministers, and every Conservative Member of Parliament and in this document I talked about Canada needing more
      emphasis on CANADIAN HERITAGE, because I had seen what was happening and that Arja was about to lose all her money
      that she had invested in the Barrie operation. I also recommended that the policy of deducting Canadian Art from
      one’s income taxes needs a revision to a maximum of $10,000. Therefore, I recommend that there should be no Income
      Tax Deduction on works by deceased artists, which I’m sure, as it was intended to be in so many years ago.
      Hopefully, your government can now concentrate in helping current Living Artists and those would be artists,
      perhaps by additional art programs in schools, just like sports. A very good reason to change that original law,
      and it would be just common sense.
